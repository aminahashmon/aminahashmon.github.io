    <center><h1>Big Parties- Big Problems: Breaking Away from the Democrats and Republicans </h1></center>

        <ul>
      <li>As someone who neither identifies as a Democrat or Republican, I felt it necessary to search for presidential candidiates who were not from the two largest political parties.</li>  
       <li>The recent tom-foolery brought by Trump and Clinton's childish antics has only driven me further from the two parties.</li> 
        <li>Recently, I discovered Jill Stein- a member of the Green Party.</li>
        <li>Gary Johnson- a member of the Libertarian Party- is shaking up the polls with an 8 percent approval rating from voters.</li>
        <li> Currently, only 42 state representatives identify as third-party candidates.</li>
        <li>I think its important that voters know they have other options besides Trump and Clinton.</li>
        <li>There are over twenty different third-party political groups.</li>
        
        </ul>
