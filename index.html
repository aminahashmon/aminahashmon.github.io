        I'm an 18 year old woman from Detroit, Michigan. 
    An accounting major at Western Michigan University, looking forward to life post graduation. 
    I plan on eventually starting a family, having a rewarding career in corporate America, and starting my own Accounting Firm.
    Triple A-Minah is a blog all about my thoughts on everything- from politics to fashion.
    My blog is for people of all interests and backgrounds. I tackle political and social issues from different viewpoints and pose the questions that most people don't want to ask.
    As a young, African-American woman from the inner city, I think that's its important to show the world how informed, and inquisitive young people can be. 
    Thanks for logging on!
